"Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally. They have not yet lost control; not enough time has passed. Similarly, because prostitution has been illegal in many places, even where it has become legal, there is a tendency for it to initially be dominated by the sometimes violent pimps who prevailed when it was illegal. As time passes, in large areas where it is fully legal, it will become less dominated by the criminal element and less violent (although it will never cease to be unpleasant in other ways).",prostitution,FAVOR,1

That sounds all well in good in a rose-coloured-glasses kind of way, but the unvarnished truth is that parents home-school because they dont like the cirriculum at a public school.

Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things.

The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled.

The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana.

Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania.

"It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation.

I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage.

Essentially, require a deposit on the meal.

"It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers.

This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors.

Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince.

While she might not have been my favorite visitor to my office due to some of her behaviors (Which seem quite innocuous by the way), holding her back a year only acts as an incentive to others to toe the school's rather arcane method of enforcing an Orwellian form of discipline and thought control. Should she remain at the school, my impression is that she will either act out more aggressively to these absurd rules, or capitulate and become a drone-like student.

The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone.

The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled.

There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains.

At one table, 3 women, 2 men. They were all attractive young people, and you would think the females might be talking with the guys, yes? No - the 3 females were busy checking each other's photos and text messages on all 3 of their iPhones, giggling, sharing, not interacting with the guys at all. I wanted to go over and tell them, Hey, do you realize you have some great opportunities to learn about these guys here, if you just talked with them?",vaccination,NONE,1
"Did anyone expect this NOT to happen? Charter schools are a failed experiment in new ways to discriminate against the poor and minority. Ban such schools, or at least refuse to give one single dime to schools that discriminate like this. Lay down the law with these schools that invent new ways to do evil.",office layout,NONE,1
"The foolishness and selfishness of arguments like these never ceases to amaze me. I've had this argument with other anti-vaxxer parents, and they can't seem to get it through their skulls that the MAIN reason they don't HAVE to vaccinate their children-is be cause all the other responsible parents have already done so!!! They lack any understanding of what a social contract is or why it is necessary for civil life to continue, let alone the danger their sweet little child poses to people vulnerable to these diseases. Hey, why should I pay my taxes to pave my streets when all my neighbors have me covered on that one? Jeez",early learning,NONE,1
"It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.",mine,NONE,1
"The ones who teach should be very concerned. Every time schools at any level, or education systems anywhere, or the ones who teach get tested or graded or rated somehow, it is always the teachers who get fired. Never the students. Or the parents. Or the system. THE TEACHERS. And no, I have never been a teacher or a school employee - just a student and an observer.",company,NONE,1
"I think the time to learn a language is early, in elementary school. That's when being exposed to other ways of speaking, doing things, other cultures, can make such an impact. In college it's just a burden, and a very expensive burden with the cost of tuition.",workplace,NONE,1
"Most western countries require a 2nd language. Frankly, it was embarrassing when I was in England and all the other students (all Europeans) could speak at least one other language other than their native language. Even American kids from Ivies couldn't speak another language. And this was back in the 70s before the internet really made the world much smaller.",overcrowd,NONE,1
"Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.",vaccination,NONE,1
"If law schools were public elementary, middle, or secondary schools, someone would already be talking about closing or selling the ones that don't produce enough graduates who can pass the bar exam. In truth, many start out, but few arrive. Has anyone ever questioned whether the bar is too low for art or music school?",kid home,NONE,1
"Part of the problem, as evidenced here, is that child psychiatrists are not included in the discussion. I agree that ADHD is overdiagnosed. Many conditions, including mood disorders, anxiety, trauma, and attachment disorders present with attention and executive function problems. We are trained to diagnose and treat these disorders. It's a little more complicated than using the DSM like a chinese restaurant menu and throwing stimulants at a kid if they meet a certain number of criteria. I believe that the frustration expressed by the article's authors is a result of their lack of training in this particular area. I would be saying the same things if I were required to manage someone's hypertension.",syria,NONE,1
"Activists run for elected office and are elected frequently, and they advocate for their causes just like every politician advocates for something. They usually accomplish their purposes and sometimes what they introduce actually remains after they leave office. As public servants they tend to be focused upon their core constituents and their core issues and tend to trivialize the concerns which do not relate to them. They really feel that the day to day concerns of people who they formally represent but really do not wish to bother worrying about do not matter or can be ignored as they follow their passions. One of the reasons that so many people feel alienated by politicians is the way local politicians are preoccupied with causes and special interests.",religious deed,NONE,1
