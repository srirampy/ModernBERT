I am confused. I was under the impression she helped people who were suffering because they were ill and unable to help themselves because they were poor.

"Tips help the resturant owner more than the employee. They don't need to pay SS/Fica taxes on tips, esp if the waitstaff don't report. I still contend that giving someone a tip when I'm done eating does not guarantee me good service. Many simply expect the tip. Some get bent if what you give isn't what they expected even if the tip reflected the service they provided. Business should pay a fair wage, disallow tips and charge accordingly. Then, if they get complaints about shoddy service, deal with the employee accordingly.",restaurant service,AGAINST,1
"The Government has no business controlling its workers' free speech on religoius matters during off-hoursand to attempt to do so amounts to goverment endorsement of which religious practices are acceptable. This is easily demonstrable -- as follows: A person is an adherent to a new religion. This religion believes that the holy books of three large monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have been corrupted, have errors and therefore must be cleansed. The required cleansing is done by fire. Each Sabbath, adherents must burn one page of each of the holy books for these faiths. It is a bona-fide belief helf by adherents to this faith. If the government prevents them from conducting their cleansing ceremony because others are offended, then it is clearly taking sides on what does and does not constitute acceptable religous beliefs and practices.",control worker government,AGAINST,1

"It's hard to take an argument seriously when it asserts outright falsehoods. The federal minimum wage for *all* employees is $7.25 per hour. Under no circumstance can any wait staff make less than this. Because tips are wages, tips are included in the minimum wage calculation. The $2.13 is the so-called tipped subminimum wage: extra cash employers have to pay even if your tips place your wages substantially higher than the minimum wage. I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage. Better to set a fair minimum wage and eliminate the subminimum wage.

"I hate pot. I think putting it in candy is stupid. However, even though I gave it up after 2 years of thinking thee must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it, I came to the conclusion that it was so far from addictive that it probably drove some people to abandon it in favor of mindless drug like cocaine, heroin or beer and booze.

We all know why some people support beauty pageants - because there's money to be made from exhibiting the bodies of little girls and young women, thanks to trashy parents.

"Bruce S. Cooper's reasoning lacks supporting evidence: home-schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money just as parents' whose ill children miss several days of public school do not save taxpayers money. Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars. Public schools still have to be built, maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools. Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money. Flinging around statistics about the average per pupil cost of public education is not the same thing as providing evidence that private or home education reduce the necessary expenditures of public school systems.

"The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball. (That is not the case for baseball.) Academics are secondary. The answer to the dilemma is clear but unlikely: divorce the franchise and the academic operations. Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise.",athlete,AGAINST,1

States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on.

In this sense I agree that smartphones/facebook can be potentially damaging to relationships or at least to proper social conduct.",socializing without technology,AGAINST,1
"OK. If Assad regime is toppled by the rebels/by ISIS/by external forces, what is the next scenario? Who will feel the void? Isn t it better that Assad stays for the time being, destroy ISIS and then come to an agreement with Assad ( with hard pressure from the NATO plus Russia) to declare a free election ASAP! In my opinion the shortest and smartest way to free Syria would be to build a democratic society with fully functional institutions and good governance. So, there is a long to-do lists for the Syrian people. It will take a solid International cooperation and UN mandate to achieve this achievable goal. It won t come for free. There will be blood shedding and the people must be ready for sacrifice to earn a decent future for the next generations. Fundamental to this is the long awaited reform within Islam. As long as Islam is allowed to be mishandled and abused by militants and Jihadists and killers, all will be futile. Moderate Syrians need a hard soul searching.

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country.

Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania.

The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.,immigrant problem,AGAINST,1

This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs.

It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it.

The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member.

There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good.

The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children. The next logical step in this proposal is that parents would be directly taxed for the cost of educating their children, and we'd sure see a permanent class divide if that were to happen.",vaccination,NONE,1

"The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once.

Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana.

Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition.

Any intervention is a slippery slope to full involvement which is why we should stay as far away from Syria as possible no matter what they do. Lookt at Libya -- we started out with R2P just to save those Jihadist in Benghazi from Qaddafi. Well it quickly morpher into regime change in violation of the UN SC resolution. So we acted outside the law. We didn't care we are the US - we are not bound by any LAW not even one passed in Congress. And regime change in Libya led to the muder of a US Ambassador -- does anyone think that what is about to happen will end any differently. The President will lie to us as we were lied to about NSA and lied to about US intentions in Libya. In another month we will be bleeding and dying in Syria to remove Assad and install Al Nusra in power -- the so called FSA will either defect to Al Nusra or be buthchered by them.

"I would like to suggest an additional choice. If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.",home schoolers,NONE,1
No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country. By simply setting foot on American soil they gain many legal and Constitutional rights.,refugee,NONE,1

"I personally believe that whatever the outcome of the civil war, the one outcome which would lead to a much wider and more destructive war would be a true victory by Assad's forces which would empower Hezbollah and project Iranian power through its erstwhile clients to the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.",civil war,NONE,1

Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections.

We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition.

We know the answer to that one, and we also know that promised yields never seem to show up. This is deja vu all over again.",motherhood,NONE,1
"Marriage as it pertains to government's involvement is an issue of tax law, entitlement benefits and property rights (especially in the case of divorce), government should not be defining morality. Leave morality to the churches, etc. Either government legally protects consenting adults to enter into any type of marriage and provides equal benefits in such unions, or the government completely removes itself from all marriages.",marriage,NONE,1

"This is a horrible idea. Anyone who has worked on the border, or in Mexico (as I do), knows there are plenty of middle and upper-class Mexicans who come to the U.S. for an education. I think Dr. Lee is really perpetuating stereotypes here. In my opinion, affirmative action should be based on economic class, no matter what the race.",patent monopoly,NONE,1
The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.,legitimate threat,NONE,1
Markowitz like most other liberals is in fact the ultimate hypocrite. When the Red states passed their anti-illegal laws liberals response was that they usurped the Federal Government's role as the sole authority where immigration was concerned. How does this proposal not do exactly the same thing albeit in the opposite direction?,mandatory child,NONE,1
